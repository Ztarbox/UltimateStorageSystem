# ULTIMATE STORAGE SYSTEM - The Ultimate Solution for Your Inventory in Stardew Valley 1.6

## Introduction

Welcome to the "ULTIMATE STORAGE SYSTEM" – your new way to effortlessly manage all your items in the game!
This mod revolutionizes how you interact with your inventory, making storing and retrieving items easier and more efficient than ever before.


## Key Features

Centralized Inventory: Access all your owned items from a single computer terminal.

Sorting Options: Sort your items by name, quantity, individual value, or total value – ascending or descending. Simply click on the respective column header. Clicking multiple times toggles the sorting direction.

Color Coding: Items with different quality levels are color-coded for better visibility.

Search Function: Use the powerful search function to find items by name. The search considers not just the beginning of the word but also within item names.

Scrolling: Scroll through all your items either with the scrollbar or conveniently with the mouse wheel of the middle mouse button.

Intelligent Item Transfer System: Assign each item type a storage location in a chest or refrigerator just once. The terminal will handle the rest, automatically transferring your items to the correct locations.
Left-click: Transfers up to one stack of the selected item or all available items, depending on how many items of that type are available.
Left-click + Shift: Transfers up to half a stack or half of the available quantity.
Right-click: Transfers a single item.
Right-click + Shift: Transfers 10 items of the type. The system ensures that one item always remains in the storage chest, so the storage location doesn't need to be reassigned. Only on a second click will the last item be removed.

Workbench Integration: Place a workbench directly next to the terminal to access all your items from there as well.﻿

Language Support: The mod supports all languages. While the column headers are fixed in English due to the GUI, all items, HUD notifications, terminal display at the vendor, and in the player inventory are displayed in the selected game language.
